The customer service given by this company is second to none. Communication is excellent with very prompt responses. I asked if it would be possible for an amendment to one of my orders and this was attended to without any questioning. In addition, I had a minor query about the other order as an item was missing. There was no hesitation in resolving the issue quickly and efficiently. Both gifts which I had ordered were very well received. It is so reassuring to deal with Jonathan and the rest of the staff. They all deserve every success.\n",
